      content: "This API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the status of\
        \ a response.\n\nThere are two main categories of error responses. Each have\
        \ a different response payload structure.\n\n* Simple errors\n* Detailed errors\n\
        \n\n# Simple errors\n\n| Name | Code | Description |\n| -------- | --------\
        \ | -------- |\n| Bad request     | 400     | The request was unacceptable\
        \     |\n| Unauthorized     | 401     | The request has not been applied because\
        \ it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.     |\n\
        | Forbidden     | 403     | The server understood the request, but is refusing\
        \ to fulfill it     |\n| Not Found     | 404     | The server has not found\
        \ anything matching the request URI     |\n| Not acceptable     | 406    \
        \ | The server is unable to return a response in the format that was requested\
        \ by the client     |\n| Unsupported Media Type     | 415     | The server\
        \ is refusing to service the request because the entity of the request is\
        \ in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method\
